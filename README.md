# Welcome to GSIUXD Community

Get Started in UX Designâ€”A community in India on Slack, driven to spread awareness and help new UXers transition into the field and make a place for themselves. I would like to introduce India's first UX Community specifically on Slack that's highly engaged and aimed for designers, professors, developers, engineers, product managers, and students those who want to learn or mentor in the field of user experience design. One can check out our recent [community website](http://www.gsiuxd.co).


## This is not just another UX design community

Do you know...What does a real persona look like? Do you want to transform your career into the field of User Experience design? When to select a particular user research method and how? How to go about KPI aka Key Performance Indicators? What's the difference in between Information architects, Interaction designer, User Centered Designer, and User Experience Designer? How to test and validate a product idea that will work for your end users? Do you even know your end users, yet? How about writing a compelling UX copy for a 404 page that still says, "Page Not Found?" Are you still confused how to go about a UX project from scratch? And the list goes on...

If you have more questions or even an expert to answer these, we have a dedicated UX community for that. And it takes less than 30 secs.

Joining our UX Slack community is very easy. Just log on to our website and complete the type form having 5 questions, that's it. Thank you!

## How can I join if I'm not from India

We love hear and connect with all designers from different countries, and of course there is no restriction as such. You can still join our UX community and give us a small intro such as where you're from and what you do, etc.
